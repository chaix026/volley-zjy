# Volleyball players' stats analysis
In this fun project, I scraped data from volleyservice.ru website for top players and compared their stats to see how my favorite player Zhang compares to other players as an outside hitter. 

## Data query
- Query: I used the BeautifulSoup library to query the player stats website to get their player stats. 
- Translate: Since the data are in Russian, I then used Google Translator api to translate them into English for further analysis
- Save: I saved the cleaned data for further analysis and visualization

## Data visualization
-  Prep: I transformed raw stats into each player's ranking to make different variables comparable in terms of each player's relative strengths/weaknesses
-  Radar chart: I used a radar chart to visualize my favorite player Zhang's performance in comparison to others
